        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Crop Recommendation System. Our goal is to help farmers and gardeners choose the best crops to grow based on soil conditions and environmental factors. By leveraging data and technology, we aim to optimize agricultural practices and improve crop yields.</p>
        <p>Our system takes into account various factors such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall to provide accurate crop recommendations. Whether you are a small-scale gardener or a large-scale farmer, our system can help you make informed decisions about what to plant.</p>
        <p>We believe in sustainable agriculture and strive to support farmers in making data-driven decisions that benefit both their yield and the environment.</p>
